My first attempt at making a web page (in my early thirties)

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Immediate reaciton upon "finishing" is that this was hard!
- It took a lot of time. 4 hours, 44 minutes by my tracking
- I lost momentum. I worked on this for a few days in a row, then took more than one month off. It took 2 more days to finish

My #1 lesson learned: Have a master strategy for how you want to lay out the elements on the page. What are the major divs/containers? What goes in each? How will you position them? This is sort of like outlining a paper or slide deck, but with much more variety in the contents

What I wish I would have tried:
- Apply the lesson above
- Systematically lay out each "layer 1" element (i.e., the biggest "buckets" on the page")
- Fill in each outline
